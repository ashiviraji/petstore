[comment]: <> (## Specification examples)

[comment]: <> (By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.)

[comment]: <> (Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.)

[comment]: <> (More information on MicroProfile can be found [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/&#41;)

[comment]: <> (### Config)

[comment]: <> (Configuration of your application parameters. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config&#41;)

[comment]: <> (The example class **ConfigTestController** shows you how to inject a configuration parameter and how you can retrieve it programmatically.)

[comment]: <> (### Fault tolerance)

[comment]: <> (Add resilient features to your applications like TimeOut, RetryPolicy, Fallback, bulkhead and circuit breaker. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance&#41;)

[comment]: <> (The example class **ResilienceController** has an example of a FallBack mechanism where an fallback result is returned when the execution takes too long.)

[comment]: <> (### Health)

[comment]: <> (The health status can be used to determine if the 'computing node' needs to be discarded/restarted or not. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health&#41;)

[comment]: <> (The class **ServiceHealthCheck** contains an example of a custom check which can be integrated to health status checks of the instance.  The index page contains a link to the status data.)

[comment]: <> (### Metrics)

[comment]: <> (The Metrics exports _Telemetric_ data in a uniform way of system and custom resources. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics&#41;)

[comment]: <> (The example class **MetricController** contains an example how you can measure the execution time of a request.  The index page also contains a link to the metric page &#40;with all metric info&#41;)

[comment]: <> (### JWT Auth)

[comment]: <> (Using the OpenId Connect JWT token to pass authentication and authorization information to the JAX-RS endpoint. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client&#41;)

[comment]: <> (Have a look at the **TestSecureController** class which calls the protected endpoint on the secondary application.)

[comment]: <> (The **ProtectedController** &#40;secondary application&#41; contains the protected endpoint since it contains the _@RolesAllowed_ annotation on the JAX-RS endpoint method.)

[comment]: <> (The _TestSecureController_ code creates a JWT based on the private key found within the resource directory.)

[comment]: <> (However, any method to send a REST request with an appropriate header will work of course. Please feel free to change this code to your needs.)

[comment]: <> (### Open API)

[comment]: <> (Exposes the information about your endpoints in the format of the OpenAPI v3 specification. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-open-api&#41;)

[comment]: <> (The index page contains a link to the OpenAPI information of your endpoints.)

[comment]: <> (### Open Tracing)

[comment]: <> (Allow the participation in distributed tracing of your requests through various micro services. Specification [here]&#40;https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing&#41;)

[comment]: <> (To show this capability download [Jaeger]&#40;https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/#binaries&#41; and run ```./jaeger-all-in-one```.)

[comment]: <> (Open [http://localhost:16686/]&#40;http://localhost:16686/&#41; to see the traces. Mind that you have to access your demo app endpoint for any traces to show on Jaeger UI.)

[comment]: <> (## Deploying Application)

[comment]: <> (To deploy the demo app on a docker-compose please visit [./deploy]&#40;https://github.com/rasika/petstore/tree/master/deploy&#41;)
